# About project
The aim of this project is to create a bot that can move autonomously within the **ARC Club**, avoiding obstacles to deliver tools and other components to club members. This bot is designed to assist club members by featuring a tray and compartments for storing tools and electronic components required in the club. It also includes a touchscreen displaying a map of the club. When a person wants to send tools or components to another member, they simply place the item in the tray, select the delivery location on the screen, and the bot navigates to the specified location to complete the delivery.
