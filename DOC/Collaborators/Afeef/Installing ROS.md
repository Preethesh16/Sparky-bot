The **Robot Operating System (ROS)** is an open-source framework designed to simplify robotic software development. It provides libraries and tools for hardware control, sensor integration, and system communication, making it a popular choice for autonomous systems, drones, and robotic research.

### Key Features:

- **Modular Design**: Reusable packages for diverse tasks.
- **Communication Tools**: Facilitates inter-process communication with topics, services, and actions.
- **Simulation Support**: Integrates with Gazebo for virtual testing.

### Recommended Operating Systems:

- **Ubuntu**: Officially supported, ideal for both ROS 1 and ROS 2 (versions like 20.04 or 22.04).
- **Debian**: Partially supported; suitable for advanced users familiar with manual configuration.

For the best experience, Ubuntu is recommended due to its extensive ROS documentation and community support.
